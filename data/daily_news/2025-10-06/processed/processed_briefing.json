The lack of pre-market price action (indicated by 0.0 for premarket_range_pct, premarket_vol, and premarket_return_pct) further suggests uncertainty ahead of the open."

                    "reasoning": "The ML model's bearish bias is somewhat supported by concerns about the tech sector's valuation and potential headwinds from AI spending impacting electricity rates (Chamath Palihapitiya's warning). However, the 'High Growth Tech Stocks in US to Watch for Potential Portfolio Boost' headline and Nvidia's AI ambitions suggest some bullish elements are at play. The overnight gap up and significant premarket range hint at potential for movement, but the overall cautious sentiment weighs it down."

                    "reasoning": "The ML model's bearish bias is reinforced by the general recessionary fears and economic weakness flagged by Moody's. The pre-market return of -0.088% and a decent range suggest some downward pressure is already in play. The headline about 22 states with persistent economic weakness could disproportionately impact small-cap companies represented by IWM."

                    "reasoning": "Despite Goldman Sachs flagging 'circular revenue' risks for Nvidia, the overall narrative around AI is a dominant theme. The ML model's bullish bias aligns with the strong AI focus in the news and the potential for tech stocks to gain, although the valuation concerns add a layer of caution. The significant premarket range and overnight gap down (-1.12%) suggest potential for price discovery, but the underlying AI narrative remains a strong bullish driver."

                    "reasoning": "The ML model's bullish bias is consistent with the large overnight gap up (2.55%) and the strong previous day's range which TSLA has historically shown strength in. While no specific news directly supports TSLA, the broader positive sentiment for some growth sectors and the continued focus on AI (which TSLA is involved in, albeit indirectly with Nvidia chips) could provide tailwinds. The lack of pre-market price action is unusual given the overnight gap, suggesting potential for opening volatility."

While the news doesn't specifically target AAPL, broad market concerns about recession and the ongoing government shutdown could weigh on consumer discretionary spending, impacting a company like Apple. The substantial prior day range and strong bull action suggest prior momentum may be tested."

The headline about AI spending and electricity rates, along with the general market uncertainty, could pressure Amazon. The overnight gap up and strong prior day bull action are somewhat contradictory, but the high confidence in the bearish ML prediction, combined with recessionary fears, leans towards a bearish outlook."

The overnight gap down (-0.80%) and negative H1/H4 momentum indicators reinforce this. While broad market sentiment is mixed, the specific AI cost concerns provide a bearish catalyst for META."

While AI cost concerns were raised, GOOG's significant AI investments are also seen as a growth driver. The overall strong technicals and positive news surrounding tech growth sectors provide a bullish outlook."
