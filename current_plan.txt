Incremental Rollout and Development Timeline

To implement these improvements while ensuring stability, we will roll them out in stages:

Phase 1 – Symbol Selection & LLM Call Refactor: Start by modifying the live loop to use the new symbol subset approach and per-symbol LLM calls. Implement the pre-market context generation for all symbols (bias + news context if not already in place) and the logic to pick the top 3-5 symbols for the session. Refactor the trade_analyzer or equivalent to build prompts on a per-symbol basis and handle multiple LLM responses. Test this change in isolation (paper trading) to ensure that latency improves and outputs remain consistent. At this stage, the core strategy logic (confluences, etc.) might still be handled by the LLM as before, but the infrastructure for multiple small prompts will be in place. Monitor that the LLM’s responses per symbol are coherent and that the system correctly aggregates them.

Phase 2 – Implement Confluence Engine (Deterministic Signals): Develop and integrate the confluence detection engine. This involves writing functions for each signal (BOS, FVG, OB, etc.) and testing them on historical data or real-time feeds to ensure they trigger correctly. Once validated, incorporate the engine into the live fast-loop: instead of sending raw price data to the LLM, start populating the active_confluences in the context for each symbol in real time. During this phase, we might run the engine in parallel with the old method to cross-verify (e.g., log when the LLM says “BOS” and when our engine detects BOS, to see if they match). Gradually shift the LLM prompt to rely on the engine’s output: for example, the prompt can be changed to “Here are the detected confluences and state – analyze them” rather than “Here is price data – find confluences”. Roll this out in paper trading and verify that the LLM’s trade decisions still align with expectations when using the code-derived signals.

Phase 3 – State Tracker & Context Management: Introduce the state tracking structure per symbol and modify the context/prompt building accordingly. This is when we truly trim the prompt down using our structured state. Implement the logic for stage transitions (reversal->confirmation->entry) and ensure the context JSON reflects those in current_context. Remove legacy parts of prompts like large price dumps or repetitive text, and replace with the concise state summary. Deploy this updated context handling in a test environment – the LLM should now receive a much slimmer prompt. We need to carefully verify that the LLM still performs well: since the prompt format changed, ensure the parsing of LLM output (via Pydantic models or schema validation) still works and that the LLM understands the new input. This phase makes the system more modular and transparent, as the LLM is effectively reading our state rather than deducing everything itself. By end of this phase, the LLM is mostly confined to interpreting high-level signals and suggesting final trade details, not doing raw analysis from scratch.

Phase 4 – Integrate Post-Validator: Develop the signal validator function and insert it into the live pipeline. This is relatively straightforward: once the LLM (or rule-based logic) produces a trade proposal, run the validator checks. Test this with known scenarios (you can simulate a bad signal to see if it’s caught). During paper trading, intentionally allow the LLM to propose a few trades and ensure the validator’s decisions (pass/fail) are correct. Fine-tune the thresholds (e.g., maybe you want R:R ≥ 1.2 instead of 1.0 depending on strategy) using config constants for easy adjustment. This phase increases the safety of the system – after implementation, no trade should go live without meeting our criteria. It’s important to log the validator outcomes for later review (so we know if we’re rejecting too many signals, or if the LLM frequently suggests something invalid, which might indicate a need to adjust the prompt or engine).

Phase 5 – Backtesting Development: With the live strategy shaping up, dedicate time to building the backtesting framework as outlined. Leverage the existing test mode capabilities to feed historical data, but extend it to log results and perhaps run faster than real time. You might create a new script or notebook for backtesting that can iterate over days of historical data, or integrate it as a command-line option (e.g., --backtest 2025-09-01:2025-10-01 to simulate a range of dates). Start with a smaller scope – e.g., test one symbol over one week – then ramp up. Verify that the backtester is correctly emulating the live logic (the state transitions, confluence detections, etc., should mirror what happens live). This will likely surface bugs or edge cases in our logic that weren’t apparent in real-time (e.g., how the system handles gap opens, or sudden reversals). Fix any issues as needed and rerun until the backtest flows smoothly. Once functional, run the backtester on a broad sample of historical periods to gather performance metrics. Analyze these results to confirm improvement: ideally, the refined strategy yields a higher win rate or better risk-reward profile than the old approach (which you might also simulate for comparison). Use this data to make final tweaks to parameters (confidence thresholds, confluence combos needed, etc.).

Phase 6 – Incremental Rollout to Live: After validating via paper and backtests, plan a cautious rollout to live trading. It’s wise to start in a paper trading environment if not already, for a final end-to-end rehearsal with all new pieces. Run it for several sessions and compare its behavior to the old logs – are we seeing fewer LLM calls, faster decisions, and coherent outputs? Once satisfied, deploy to a live account but possibly with minimal risk initially (small position sizes or limited number of trades per day, etc.). Monitor performance and logs closely in the first days. We expect improved speed (due to reduced prompt sizes and parallel LLM calls) and clearer decision-making (thanks to the structured confluence logic). Any anomalies (e.g., LLM confusion or missed trades) should be addressed promptly – the modular architecture makes this easier, as we can pinpoint if an issue lies in the engine, state management, or LLM output. Over time, gradually increase trade risk allocation as confidence in the updated system grows.

Throughout all phases, prioritize clean architecture and transparency. Each module (symbol selector, confluence engine, state tracker, validator, backtester) should be fairly independent and well-documented. This not only speeds up debugging but also makes future enhancements or reviews (by you or other developers) much easier. By the end of this rollout, the trading bot will be faster, leaner, and more rule-driven, with the LLM playing a focused advisory role. All decisions and signals will be backed by quantifiable conditions (logged via the state and confluence list), greatly improving the bot’s auditability and the trader’s confidence in its actions. With robust backtesting capabilities, we’ll also be able to continuously validate and improve the strategy as market conditions evolve, all while keeping the core ICT methodology intact and systematically implemented.
